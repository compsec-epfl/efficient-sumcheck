This library was developed as part of the [eprint.iacr.org/2024/XXX](eprint.iacr.org/2024/XXX) paper using the [arkworks](https://arkworks.rs) ecosystem.

**WARNING:** This is an academic prototype and has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Overview
This library provides implementation of the sumcheck algorithm [[LFKN92](#references)]. We focus on the implementation of the prover, and implement three algorithms:
- The quasi-linear time and logarithmic space algorithm of [[CTY11](#references)]
- The linear time and linear space algorithm of [[VSBW13](#references)]
- Our new algorithm: Blendy which runs in linear time and sublinear space.

## Modules
[Prover](/src/provers/prover.rs) is a trait implemented by each algorithm<br>
[SpaceProver](/src/provers/space_prover.rs) implements the CormodeTY10 algorithm and runs in superlinear time and uses logarithmic space<br>
[TimeProver](/src/provers/time_prover.rs) implements the VuSBW13 algorithm and runs in linear time and uses linear space<br>
[BlendyProver](/src/provers/blendy_prover.rs) implements Blendy and runs in linear time and uses linear space<br>
[Proof](/src/proof.rs) is a runner that takes a Prover and randomness and runs the protocol to generate a transcript<br>
[Lag Poly](/src/lagrange_polynomial.rs) implements the sequential lagrange polynomial routine described in section 4.1<br>
[Hypercube](/src/hypercube.rs) implements `iter` for boolean hypercube members as a wrapper over a `usize`<br>

## Evaluation
We perform an evaluation of the three algorithms we implemented. The asymptotic improvement of BlendyProver translates to significantly lower memory consumption than TimeProver across all configurations tested. TimeProver and BlendyProver have similar runtimes and are orders of magnitude faster than SpaceProver.
